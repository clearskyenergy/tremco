   ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not in the shared-file list above:
   sales-proposal.html carries a hard-coded LOGO_OVERRIDE near the top of its

   been repointed here. See README → "The sales-proposal.html catch".

/* ── What each plan means ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Only three fields differ between them, so this is the whole difference
   between a trial and a paying Tier 1 account:

   trial   accountTier 'Trial'     tierLevel -1   countdown banner on
   tier1   accountTier 'Standard'  tierLevel  1   countdown gone

   tierLevel -1 sits BELOW TIER.ALL, so no tool unlocks on tier and access
   comes only from unlockedTools below — exactly 4 tools.

   tierLevel 1 unlocks every TIER.ALL and TIER.STANDARD tool in the catalog:
   16 unlocked, 17 still Upgrade-badged. See the README for the list of the
   12 that get added, since that's the commercial substance of the upgrade.

   Setting `trial: null` is what removes the countdown — omega-brand.js
   returns null from trial() when the block is absent and renders nothing.   */

       Tremco's staff mail domain is tremcoinc.com (tremcoroofing.com is the
       public web domain and the info@ inbox, not where employees receive
       mail). Both fields are set to the staff domain so real people can
       actually sign in.

       Two things make this worth a deliberate confirmation rather than a
       glance:

       1. tremcoinc.com is Tremco Incorporated — the whole company, well over
          a thousand people across divisions beyond Roofing & Building
          Maintenance. As written, ANY of them can self-serve into this
          workspace. That is a much wider gate than a small-tenant trial
          usually wants. To run a closed pilot instead, blank allowedDomain
          and list the pilot team under allowedEmails below.
       2. orgId is the hard tenant lock that scopes ALL Firestore reads, and
          allowedDomain is who may sign in. They must stay identical.        */

       say — list the extras here. They all land in the same workspace,
       because orgId above is fixed regardless of which address signs in.    */

    /* Named individuals outside the allowed domain. This is also the right
       place to run a closed pilot: blank allowedDomain above and list only

    /* Tremco's supplied wordmark, converted from the original .webp to PNG.
       No processing beyond the format change was needed — the source already
       carried a clean alpha channel, so none of the white-key work the
       previous tenant's screenshot-derived logo required applies here.

       Brand teal is #00AA91, sampled from the file.

       ONE THING TO WATCH: this is a wide wordmark (766x219, 3.5:1), where the
       previous tenant's mark was tall (0.83:1). The sign-in card renders the
       logo at height:88px, so this paints ~308px wide inside 324px of usable
       card width — it fits, with about 8px of air each side. If anyone adds
       padding to .auth-card in index.html, this is the first thing to break.
       Mobile (<=520px) drops it to 44px tall and is not tight.

       At 219px tall the source is ~2.5x the 88px render — crisp on most
       screens, marginally under 3x for a retina display. If it reads soft,
       ask Tremco for the vector original (SVG/AI/EPS) and re-export. Do not
       upscale this file; that adds blur, not detail.                        */
